# The Netball Hub

## Code Institute - Milestone Project 2

The Netball Hub is a fictional organisation that aims to inform parents with young children, in particular girls, about the benefits of playing netball from a young age. 
The aim of the website is to educate parents about the lack of netball available to young girls, the benefits of netball, and then to provide different ways parents can begin to
introduce this to their daughters if they are interested. 

The idea came to me out of frustration from my own experience as a parent to a young girl. I have found football, rugby and cricket clubs are widely available for her to attend, but when I have
taken her to these she has been the only girl. As a netball player myself I am keen to promote this sport to her, as well as team sports and ball games, but I have had to find my own ways of introducing netball to her, as there is nothing in my 
local area for her to attend. Having done some research into this, there is very little netball provision at this age across the country, however I believe it would be a great benefit to 
young children, boys and girls, if this was more widely available. I decided to create this website to promote awareness of the problem and provide other parents who may be in a similar situation with some ways to include netball in their family life if they so wish. 

This was the second of four Milestone Projects that made up the Full Stack Web Development Program at The Code Institute. The main requirements were to make an interactive and responsive website with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

## **User Experience**
This section provides insight into the UX process, focusing on who The Netball Hub website is for, the main aims of the project and how the website can help users meet their needs.  

### Project goals:

Educate, promote and engage 
* To educate people about the lack of netball available for young girls in England
* To learn about the benefits of playing netball
* To equip parents with ways they can interest and engage their children in netball
* To interest the user enough that they want to sign up to The Netball Hub newsletter to continue to be provided with more netball activities and information
* To create a website that is visually appealing, and fully responsive on all devices and screen sizes 
* To make The Netball Hub seem a reputable class provider, by creating a professional website

### User Stories

**New users:** 
* I am a user who is new to netball. I have never really considered the lack of this sport available to young children, and so I'd like to use this website to be better educated. If I then decide that I want to spend my time as a parent promoting this to my children, I want to easily be able to access content that can help me promote and engage my children in this sport. 
* I am a user who has played netball previously. I am aware that there is very little netball available for young children. I would like to encourage my children to play this sport, however I have no experience teaching it and so I am looking for this website to provide me with some activities and things I can do with my children based around netball. 
* I am a user who wants to keep up to date on ways to provide netball to my children, I want to receive the latest netball news and more activities I can do with my children. 

**Returning user:**
* I am a returning user who has already completed the quiz, and followed the video provided, but I am now looking for further things to do and ways to find out more information about netball.

**Business Owner:**
* I am one of the owners of the business and want to see it succeed. I want to promote the issue around the lack of netball for young children, and equip parents with ways netball can introduced at home. I want parents to sign up to the newsletter to continue to promote the benefits of netball and ways young children can engage in the sport.

### Strategy plane: 
The main goal of the website is to attract users to enquire about an upcoming online macrame class. The website is aimed at a Business to Consumer creative audience. It should include lots of imagery.  I started the UX process by creating the User Stories above which helped me work out who the project was aimed at and what I would need to include in the website to satisfy the needs of the users.

Welcome chloelewisdev,

This is the Code Institute student template for Gitpod. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Gitpod and the extensions we use.

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

## Updates Since The Instructional Video

We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here is the version history:

**October 21 2020:** Versions of the HTMLHint, Prettier, Bootstrap4 CDN and Auto Close extensions updated. The Python extension needs to stay the same version for now.

**October 08 2020:** Additional large Gitpod files (`core.mongo*` and `core.python*`) are now hidden in the Explorer, and have been added to the `.gitignore` by default.

**September 22 2020:** Gitpod occasionally creates large `core.Microsoft` files. These are now hidden in the Explorer. A `.gitignore` file has been created to make sure these files will not be committed, along with other common files.

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

Happy coding! -->
